# Data Analysis of Population Trends in Asian Countries

### Data Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/)

#### Project Overview:
This analysis presents an in-depth examination of population data for various Asian countries from 1960 to 2022. The project, my first as a Data Science intern at Prodigy Infotech, focuses on gender-wise distribution in the population.

### Key Insights:

### Top 5 Most Populated Countries in 2022:
- India, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are the top five most populated Asian countries based on total population.
- India and China also dominate the list based on male population, while China leads in terms of female population.

### Population Distribution:
- India and China exhibit population distributions that surpass other countries, with variations between male and female populations.
- India's male population is uniformly distributed, while China's male population shows a slight shift towards higher values.
- In contrast, India's female population has a slight shift towards higher values, while China's female population is more evenly distributed.

### Detailed Population Analysis:
- In India, the male population peaks between 200-300 million, and the female population peaks between 500-650 million.
- China's male population is right-skewed, primarily concentrated between 500-700 million, while the female population shows slight peaks around 200-280 million.
- Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have relatively uniform population distributions between 24-112 million.

### Comparison of 1960 and 2022:
- In 1960, all five countries had populations under 350 million, with variations in male-female ratios.
- By 2022, populations had increased, with India and China surpassing 700 million.
- India's male population increased, while China's female population saw growth.
- Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh showed population increases with relatively balanced gender distributions.

### Population Trends:
- All countries experienced population growth from 1960 to 2022.
- India's female population exceeded the male population until 2010 when the trend reversed.
- China consistently had a higher male population from 1960.
- Indonesia, Pakistan, and Bangladesh displayed similar growth patterns with relatively balanced male-female ratios.

### Population Changes from 1960 to 2022:
- In India, the female population decreased by 10% in 2022 compared to 1960, while the male population increased by 10%.
- China saw a 10.1% increase in the female population but a 10% decrease in the male population.
- Pakistan's female population increased by 3.6% in 2022, while the male population decreased by 4.4%.
- Indonesia and Bangladesh showed somewhat equal male-female ratios in 2022 compared to 1960.

### Conclusion:
These insights provide valuable information for understanding population dynamics in Asian countries over the years. It is clear that India and China remain at the forefront of population statistics, with noteworthy shifts in gender distribution. These observations can inform further research and policy decisions related to population growth, gender demographics, and resource planning.
